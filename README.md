# Censorship-Data-Driven-DNS-Resolution-Anomaly-Detection
This project utilizes bidirectional active probing to gather domain censorship data from various national cyberspaces, encompassing typical domain resolution anomalies, forming a set of DNS resolution anomaly samples. Additionally, employing stacked ensemble learning, a DNS resolution anomaly detection model is developed..
